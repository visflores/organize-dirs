# ORGANIZE-DIRS!

## Hello, Traveller!

I worked on this little project to organize my photographs and I think will be a good idea to share with people fighting against the same problem: **Disorganization!!!**

I hope you all enjoy, but first you need to install two packages: numpy and hurry.filesize. 

Before the installation, you're able to organize your archives in three ways:

	1. By size;
	2. By date;
	3. By extension.

Execute the script organize\_gui.py to start the program and have fun!

Fell free to change this little program and adapt to your usage!

This is the first version, in the future I will make some changes and improvements.

(Please, pay attention using this program. This is the first version and bugs certainly exist)

Cheers!
